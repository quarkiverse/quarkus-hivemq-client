# Session Management - Git Ignore Rules (Folder-Based)

# Keep all active sessions private by default (uncommitted work)
# This ignores session-current.md in any user folder
*/session-current.md

# Optional: Keep entire user folders private
# Uncomment the folders you want to keep private:
# pablo_gonzalez_granados/
# alice/
# Bob_Smith/

# Optional: Keep backup folders private
../backup-tasks-*/

# Allow specific archived sessions to be shared by explicitly adding them:
# git add -f pablo_gonzalez_granados/session-001.md
# git add -f alice/session-005.md

# Or allow entire user folders to be shared:
# git add -f pablo_gonzalez_granados/
