# ClaudeFast Sub-agents Suite

## Overview

This directory contains a comprehensive suite of specialized sub-agents designed to enhance Claude Code development workflows. These agents replace and extend the previous SuperClaude framework with native Claude Code sub-agent support.

**üìù Code Examples Migration**: All implementation examples and code snippets have been moved from agent files to:
- **Implementation patterns**: @.claude/context/rules/
- **Code examples**: @.claude/context/examples/
- **System workflows**: @.claude/context/control/

Agent files now focus on WHAT each agent does (roles, responsibilities, coordination patterns) rather than HOW (specific implementation details).

## Agent Architecture

### Tier 1: Master Orchestration Agent
- **master-orchestrator** - Unified planning and coordination intelligence combining strategic architecture with tactical execution. Handles ALL technical planning, task breakdown, TodoWrite integration, and session orchestration

### Tier 2: Core Development Agents
- **frontend-specialist** - React components, UI implementation, forms, responsive design  
- **backend-engineer** - Server actions, database operations, API development
- **security-auditor** - Security reviews, RLS policies, OWASP compliance
- **quality-engineer** - Testing strategies, test automation, quality assurance

### Tier 3: Specialized Domain Agents
- **performance-optimizer** - Core Web Vitals, bundle optimization, database tuning
- **supabase-specialist** - Database design, RLS policies, Edge Functions, real-time features
- **debugger-detective** - Systematic debugging, root cause analysis, forensic investigation
- **deep-researcher** - Technical research, evidence gathering, Context7 integration
- **content-copywriter** - All content creation: website copy, landing pages, blog posts, email marketing, SEO-optimized content

## Usage Patterns

### Direct Agent Invocation
Use the Task tool to invoke specific agents for specialized tasks:
- @master-orchestrator: analyze codebase and coordinate feature implementation
- @frontend-specialist: create responsive dashboard components
- @security-auditor: review authentication systems

### Auto-selection by Claude
Claude automatically selects appropriate agents based on context:
- "Build a workspace analytics feature with real-time updates" ‚Üí master-orchestrator coordinates supabase-specialist, frontend-specialist
- "Our app is loading slowly, help optimize performance" ‚Üí master-orchestrator analyzes and coordinates performance-optimizer

### Multi-agent Coordination
Complex tasks requiring multiple specialists:
- "Implement a complete user invitation system with security and real-time notifications" ‚Üí master-orchestrator analyzes, plans, and coordinates backend-engineer, security-auditor, supabase-specialist, quality-engineer

## Integration with Project Patterns

### Context Loading Strategy
Each agent is designed to reference relevant patterns from `.claude/context/rules/`:

**Agent Pattern References:**
- master-orchestrator ‚Üí ALL patterns (comprehensive codebase oversight and living documentation)
- frontend-specialist ‚Üí nextjs-react-patterns.md, ui-styling-patterns.md, forms-state-patterns.md
- backend-engineer ‚Üí api-auth-patterns.md, supabase-database-patterns.md
- security-auditor ‚Üí api-auth-patterns.md, supabase-database-patterns.md
- quality-engineer ‚Üí performance-testing-patterns.md, playwright-mcp-patterns.md
- master-orchestrator ‚Üí @.claude/context/control/system-workflows.md, session templates
- performance-optimizer ‚Üí performance-testing-patterns.md, nextjs-react-patterns.md
- supabase-specialist ‚Üí supabase-database-patterns.md, api-auth-patterns.md
- debugger-detective ‚Üí ALL patterns (context-dependent)
- deep-researcher ‚Üí context7-mcp-patterns.md
- content-copywriter ‚Üí email-content-patterns.md, project-organization-patterns.md, nextjs-react-patterns.md, typescript-patterns.md

### SuperClaude Migration Map

## Agent Tool Permissions

### Master Orchestration Agent
- **master-orchestrator**: `read`, `edit`, `multi-edit`, `write`, `grep`, `glob`, `ls`, `web_search`, `task` (full access for comprehensive oversight and living documentation)

### Read-Only Agents (Analysis & Strategy)
- **security-auditor**: `read`, `grep`, `glob`, `web_search`

## Quality Standards

### Agent Development Principles
1. **Domain Expertise**: Each agent focuses on specific technical domains
2. **Context Integration**: All agents reference project patterns and examples  
3. **Evidence-Based**: Recommendations based on established best practices
4. **Security-First**: Security considerations integrated into all workflows
5. **Performance-Aware**: Performance implications considered in all implementations

### Output Consistency
All agents follow structured output formats:
- **Analysis**: Current state assessment and recommendations
- **Implementation**: Complete code with explanations and integration guidance
- **Quality**: Testing, security, and performance considerations
- **Integration**: How the implementation fits with existing patterns

## Testing & Validation

### Agent Validation Checklist
- [ ] Agent description includes clear use cases and examples
- [ ] Expertise areas are well-defined and focused
- [ ] Integration with project patterns is documented
- [ ] Output format is structured and consistent
- [ ] Tool permissions match agent responsibilities
- [ ] Quality standards are maintained

### Usage Analytics
Track agent effectiveness:
- Most frequently invoked agents
- Success rate of agent recommendations
- Integration quality with project patterns
- User satisfaction with agent outputs

## Best Practices

### When to Use Specific Agents
- **Complex Architecture & Feature Development**: Start with `master-orchestrator` for comprehensive analysis, planning, and coordination
- **Codebase Analysis & Documentation Updates**: Use `master-orchestrator` for living documentation maintenance
- **Performance Issues**: Begin with `master-orchestrator` for analysis, then coordinate `performance-optimizer`
- **Security Reviews**: Always include `security-auditor` for auth/data access changes
- **Database Work**: Prefer `supabase-specialist` for Supabase-specific implementations

### Agent Chaining Patterns
**Master Orchestration**: master-orchestrator analyzes, plans, and coordinates, then delegates to specialists, followed by quality-engineer validation.

**Security-First Development**: master-orchestrator coordinates overall flow, security-auditor reviews requirements, backend-engineer implements secure APIs, frontend-specialist builds secure UI, quality-engineer validates security testing.

**Performance Optimization**: master-orchestrator analyzes and coordinates optimization strategy, performance-optimizer implements improvements, specialists handle domain-specific optimizations, with documentation updates throughout.

## Evolution & Maintenance

### Agent Improvement Process
1. **Usage Monitoring**: Track which agents are most/least effective
2. **Pattern Updates**: Update agents when project patterns evolve
3. **Capability Enhancement**: Add new skills based on development needs
4. **Quality Refinement**: Improve output quality based on user feedback
